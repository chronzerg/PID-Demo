# PID-Demo

PID-Demo is a simple visual example of a PID loop in action. The goal of the feedback system is to place the white box at the same x coordinate as your mouse cursor. The box is connected to a point mass, governed by simple newtonian physics. The PID loop controls the ammount of force being applied to said mass.
