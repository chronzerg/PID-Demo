# PID-Demo

PID-Demo is a simple visual example of a PID loop in action. The goal of the feedback system is to place the police car at the same coordinates as your mouse cursor. The car is connected to a point mass, governed by simple newtonian physics. The PID loop controls the ammount of force being applied to said mass in the X and Y directions. The car always points in the direction of its 2D velocity.
